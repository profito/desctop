Readme File for winLAME
-----------------------

  winLAME is an encoder for several audio formats, including mp3 (MPEG
  Layer 3), Ogg Vorbis and more. winLAME lets you set up the encoding
  process with an easy-to-use wizard-style user interface.

  winLAME supports many input audio formats, and uses the LAME mp3 encoding
  library for encoding and the MAD decoding library for decoding.

  winLAME is distributed and licensed under the GNU General Public License
  (GPL). See the file COPYING for more information.

  Note that personal and/or commercial use of compiled versions of the LAME
  encoding engine (including the DLL distributed with winLAME) requires a
  patent license in some countries. Check before using winLAME!

  More documentation can be found in the winLAME HTML Help File that was
  installed along with winLAME (only in the full installer).

  winLAME is available as source code and in binary form, at winLAME's home
  page at SourceForge:
